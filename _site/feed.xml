While talking about how their interviews for other engineers go, I asked the following question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you know if the candidate you’re interviewing will be a good communicator and collaborator?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My two friends looked at me and asked me to elaborate. So I did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you ever ask how someone would handle reviewing a PR that (a) doesn’t follow a PR template that’s well defined, (b) doesn’t include the info the engineer needs to test drive it, or (c) requires a lot of feedback and/or working with the other engineer to sort out the issues?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My two friends looked at me again and asked me why it would be valuable to ask that question. I elaborated further:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well you don’t know how this candidate might handle something he/she will be doing everyday at work. Something that involves other people on the team. How are you going to know if this person will be able to work effectively with others, offer constructive feedback to another engineer on PRs, and clearly communicate that feedback?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My two friends looked at me and commented on how interesting that idea was. So I spoke to my own experience getting interviewing and interviewing non-engineers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A lot of the questions I get asked or ask candidates is how they would handle specific behavioral situations, such as a designer who doesn’t think the agile process we have is not useful, yet everyone else on the team does, or an engineer who is adding acceptance criteria to a ticket that is counter to what you initially added. As a product manager we work on teams with different skillsets and different personalities, and we have to know how to handle these situations. It’s the same for designers, engineers, or any other discipline that’s working in a cross-functional team. Right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My two friends looked at me again and commented on how behavioral questions aren’t asked very often in the interview process. It’s mostly technical plus cultural fit (which I wrote about how we need to shift the mindset and focus on &lt;a href=&quot;http://hussaindhanani.com/blog/2017/09/24/culture-fit-or-culture-add.html&quot;&gt;cultural add&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added my two cents again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wouldn’t it make sense to have some questions that would help uncover whether a candidate would make a good team contributor vs an individual contributor, rather than hire that candidate and find out later? Especially if that person ends up being the opposite of what you were actually looking for?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think at that point we all had a sip of our drinks in silence as the music changed from something forgetful to something even more forgetful, yet still providing an opportunity to think about the conversation we just had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what do you think?&lt;/strong&gt; Are behavioral questions just as valuable for engineering interviews? Should the focus be solely on technical chops and &lt;a href=&quot;http://hussaindhanani.com/blog/2017/09/24/culture-fit-or-culture-add.html&quot;&gt;cultural add&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Several months ago I was at a restaurant chatting with a few friends, all of whom were engineers.

How about when you were chatting with a prospective candidate over the phone in order to suss out if he/she had the potential of fitting in with the company’s culture? Chances are the idea of culture fit came up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture fit is a phrase most companies use to determine if a potential candidate will fit in with the team or the organization as a whole. A lot of tech companies use it and it’s probably a common phrase at other types of organizations too. We deem a candidate a good culture fit if they align with our values, they get a long with the team, and we can see ourselves working with this individual for a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that, while culture fit is an appropriate topic to discuss, it seems to be killing our ability to hire an incredibly diverse set of individuals. Individuals that have the potential to add so much value to a team and the entire organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the topic of  culture fit came up in conversations, I honestly didn’t think anything of it. Not until a recent colleague pointed out that we shouldn’t think of a potential candidate as being a good culture fit but being an excellent &lt;strong&gt;culture add&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple modification to how we talk about candidates completely changed my perspective and those around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it. Take a roughly homogenous team and talk about a potential candidate’s culture fit. Imagine the number of potentials that would literally be disqualified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now make that one simple modification and start talking about culture add instead. What do you get? A realm of possibility opens up when it comes to figuring out who the best candidate might be. Imagine how much stronger a team can be built by following this slight modification. Now let’s turn that modification into a principle we can all practice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t hire someone that will just fit in with your company and/or team culture. Hire a candidate that will beneficially &lt;em&gt;add&lt;/em&gt; to your culture and make it even better!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so thankful to have been given this simple modification because I think we can all use a few more culture adds in our organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The last time you were in a team huddle trying to decide if a candidate was going to fit in, how did that conversation go?

To kick this off again, I wanted to talk about something that is very dear to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an agent of change involves internalizing the principles of diversity and inclusion. It means that you live the principles and ideas you are trying to promote - both professionally and personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed that we are strong in advocating for and practicing the principles of diversity and inclusion at work. We fall short when we transition from the office to our personal lives. Most people I’ve observed have homogenous social circles outside of work. Because we don’t apply these principles to every aspect of our lives, we’re minimizing our chances to make a significant impact in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it that we can fight so hard for diversity and inclusion yet keep homogenous social circles? Do we not believe the principles we are preaching or do we not see the reality of our situation? As we start to understand how to bring these principles into our personal lives will we begin to see the biggest benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not suggesting this is a universal truth, but it’s noticeable enough to write about. I also don’t hear anyone else talking about it. Only a combination of self-awareness and a critical look at who we invite into our social circles will uncover our unconscious biases and begin to remove them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what I have learned from my own self-reflection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary social circle contains men and women; straight and homosexual; deaf and hard of hearing; German, Canadian, Indian, African, Russian, Austrian, Chinese, and Japanese; low, medium, and high income; low, medium, and high risk aversion; internally driven and externally driven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not including these lists to make myself look good, but because I’ve opened my heart and my mind to make sure I get to know as many different people as I can. To learn from each and everyone out there because, at the end of the day, we all have a unique story to tell. If we are willing to listen and understand one another, we can make a positive change in this world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I haven’t published a new blog post in a very long time.

Here is my recap of how the conference went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shopify-unite-partner-documentary&quot;&gt;Shopify Unite Partner Documentary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about telling a compelling story to ignite the whole audience by speaking to how anyone can change their entire life from just a single idea. Shopify’s partner documentary kicked off the conference, and it did an incredible job at setting the tone for the next two days.  As a newcomer to the Shopify partner network I was inspired by how any one of us could empower merchants to make their businesses a success.  It also hit notes on the entrepreneurial spirit that Shopify speaks to and enables through their platform.  This really did a number on me.  Take a look at the documentary video below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6HOVX0wQOFY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;product-announcements&quot;&gt;Product Announcements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the documentary was over and the keynote address was completed, it was on to the many product announcements.  I am not going to go into detail of each announcement because I want to talk about the nature of the announcements and what Shopify did really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the thirty or so announcements (some massive and some minor) had a particular style to them that resonated with me.  Each announcement started with a background to set the context. It then went into the problem that arose from the background.  Next, the announcement itself, which was the solution to the problem.  Finally, it concluded with a sneak peak or a live demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I really enjoyed was that for some of the major announcements, the Shopify individuals went as far as reporting on how beta-testing was going.  I believe every single one of the announcements made some kind of mention towards beta-testing.  I loved this because it definitely showed me how user-centric Shopify is as a Product company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are curious to learn about the major announcements, head over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopify.com/blog/everything-we-announced-at-unite-2017&quot;&gt;Shopify’s Blog&lt;/a&gt; and have a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;individual-sessions&quot;&gt;Individual Sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the major product announcements, the conference officially kicked off.  There were 3 tracks and each track had sessions until about 5pm on the first day.  The focus of the sessions was to give attendees a closer look at all of the features that were announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a great time watching my former colleague Kyle Peatt co-host a session on &lt;a href=&quot;https://polaris.shopify.com/&quot;&gt;Shopify Polaris&lt;/a&gt;, a unified design system that both Shopify and its partners can use to create seamless experiences for Shopify merchants.  Partners seemed to really take to having their apps use the same design systems as Shopify.  It was also great to see Shopify put their weight behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;, a JavaScript library for building UI.  React has been around for quite some time now and the developer community is very active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;san-francisco-goes-dark&quot;&gt;San Francisco Goes Dark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the second day of the conference, while walking into a coffee shop in the Russian Hill district, the shop completely lost power.  Thinking it was due to the construction directly outside, we went to another place to grab a coffee and a quick breakfast.  Unbeknownst to us the power was out for the entire city north of Market St.  My phone ended up buzzing and I had a push notification letting me know that the conference centre was without power.  Breakfast was still being served there, so my colleague and I made our way to the Fort Mason Center to get coffee and food into our bellies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving there was already a large group of attendees enjoying the sunshine and chatting away while eating delicious baked goods and hot coffee.  We all ended up hanging out until about noon, when lunch was being served.  At this time another announcement was made that there would be power in one of the tents of the conference (thanks to a backup generator) and the rest of the sessions for the day would be recorded and passed on to each attendee after the conference.  Best part was, no one seemed to mind.  This was a great opportunity to meet other developers and talk to them about their stories and what they are trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was amazing to see that there were startups, as well as established brands, all thriving from building apps that live in the Shopify App Store.  The full scale of the Shopify App Store, similar to Apple’s own App Store, hit me that afternoon.  It was an incredible feeling.  It took me back to the first day, at the start of the conference, when the partner documentary was shown.  These individuals really were enabling entrepreneurs to become more successful, by providing apps that were relevant to their business models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-end&quot;&gt;The End&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shopify put on an amazing event last week.  As an attendee, I appreciated the incredible amount of detail that went into the planning and execution.  I especially enjoyed the individual product announcements that took place on the first day.  The partner documentary was the biggest winner of the conference, and I am sure most developers felt the same way.  I hope I am privileged again to attend next year when the conference is held in Toronto, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It’s been over a week since I flew down to beautiful San Francisco to attend Shopify Unite - Shopify’s annual conference for partners that build apps for the Shopify App Store.

From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/technology/tech-roundup-improving-ubers-diversity-and-culture.html&quot;&gt;Uber’s ongoing struggles with diversity and culture&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/08/523129221/google-accused-of-underpaying-female-employees&quot;&gt;Google being accused of underpaying women employees&lt;/a&gt;, you can’t go a week without reading something in the news around these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is it important to me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone that is considered an ethnic minority, I can see first hand the struggles of creating a product organization that is truly diverse.  Being in tech also means I have witnessed the struggles of tech startups to create a truly inclusive culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to be able to create an open and safe space for others to talk about these struggles and come up with strategies to tackle an issue that’s finally getting the level of attention it deserves.  I do plan on writing a future article on my observations about potential blockers that prevent organizations from being truly diverse and inclusive; but for now I want to do a quick recap of what I’ve come across over the past week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stephanie-lampkins-blendoorcom&quot;&gt;Stephanie Lampkin’s Blendoor.com&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a goal of reporting on diversity without the influence of unconscious bias, Stephanie created an app last year to report on tech companies workforce makeup.  The app rates companies based on demographics of leadership, retention stats, recruiting practices, bias, and social impact initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An initiative like Blendoor is seriously kick ass.  I am pretty amazed at which companies score higher than others.  Slack is scored lower than Microsoft.  Netflix is scored lower than HP.  I was intrigued that HP has the highest rank out of all scored companies.  There are a lot of companies that don’t have a score yet, and it will be cool to see how this evolves over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more info take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blendoor.com/&quot;&gt;Blendoor.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;style--class-vancouver&quot;&gt;Style &amp;amp; Class Vancouver&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend and co-worker of mine invited me to attend Style &amp;amp; Class on Wednesday April 12th.  The topic of the Meetup was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/styleandclass/events/238961461/&quot;&gt;Equality &amp;amp; Ideal Futures in Technology&lt;/a&gt;.  I had the honor of hearing Ashley Victoria’s presentation on sexism in the workplace.  From her real-life examples, it’s bewildering to hear how some men view women at work.  How men can behave towards women at work, or at a conference, or at a holiday party.  I was really grateful to hear these stories and to reaffirm, once again, that we can all be an ally to our co-workers and friends - no matter what their makeup or background is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a new week begins, as we see more and more articles in the news around diversity and inclusion, I encourage everyone to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a safe and open environment to discuss these issues at work and at home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue to be mindful of what we say and how that might impact how others are viewed or treated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue to look for ways to be an ally to those around you&lt;/li&gt;
