My goal is very simple: Share my ideas about the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the majority of that world is working for a product company.  I spend an incredible amount of time working for a company I believe is making a difference in the world.  And that is exciting.  Not just for me but for any of you that are reading this excuse for a blog (really I can joke about it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy the posts I write and I hope they initiate a discussion with those around you (unless you want to rant at me, which is why I have shared my twitter and github profiles in the footer).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">After hundreds of conversations, countless articles read, and numerous books consumed, I am really excited to finally start this blog.
