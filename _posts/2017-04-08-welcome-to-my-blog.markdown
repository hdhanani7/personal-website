After hundreds of conversations, countless articles read, and numerous books consumed, I am really excited to finally start this blog.  My goal is very simple: Share my ideas about the world around me.

Today the majority of that world is working for a product company.  I spend an incredible amount of time working for a company I believe is making a difference in the world.  And that is exciting.  Not just for me but for any of you that are reading this excuse for a blog (really I can joke about it).

I hope you enjoy the posts I write and I hope they initiate a discussion with those around you (unless you want to rant at me, which is why I have shared my twitter and github profiles in the footer).
