It’s been over a week since I flew down to beautiful San Francisco to attend Shopify Unite - Shopify’s annual conference for partners that build apps for the [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/).  Here is my recap of how the conference went.

## Shopify Unite Partner Documentary
Talk about telling a compelling story to ignite the whole audience by speaking to how anyone can change their entire life from just a single idea. Shopify’s partner documentary kicked off the conference, and it did an incredible job at setting the tone for the next two days.  As a newcomer to the Shopify partner network I was inspired by how any one of us could empower merchants to make their businesses a success.  It also hit notes on the entrepreneurial spirit that Shopify speaks to and enables through their platform.  This really did a number on me.  Take a look at the documentary video below.

## Product Announcements
Once the documentary was over and the keynote address was completed, it was on to the many product announcements.  I am not going to go into detail of each announcement because I want to talk about the nature of the announcements and what Shopify did really well.

Each of the thirty or so announcements (some massive and some minor) had a particular style to them that resonated with me.  Each announcement started with a background to set the context. It then went into the problem that arose from the background.  Next, the announcement itself, which was the solution to the problem.  Finally, it concluded with a sneak peak or a live demo.

One thing that I really enjoyed was that for some of the major announcements, the Shopify individuals went as far as reporting on how beta-testing was going.  I believe every single one of the announcements made some kind of mention towards beta-testing.  I loved this because it definitely showed me how user-centric Shopify is as a Product company.

## Individual Sessions
After the major product announcements, the conference officially kicked off.  There were 3 tracks and each track had sessions until about 5pm on the first day.  The focus of the sessions was to give attendees a closer look at all of the features that were announced.

I had a great time watching my former colleague Kyle Peatt co-host a session on [Shopify Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/), a unified design system that both Shopify and its partners can use to create seamless experiences for Shopify merchants.  Partners seemed to really take to having their apps use the same design systems as Shopify.  It was also great to see Shopify put their weight behind [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), a JavaScript library for building UI.  React has been around for quite some time now and the developer community is very active.

## San Francisco Goes Dark
On the second day of the conference, while walking into a coffee shop in the Russian Hill district, the shop completely lost power.  Thinking it was due to the construction directly outside, we went to another place to grab a coffee and a quick breakfast.  Unbeknownst to us the power was out for the entire city north of Market St.  My phone ended up buzzing and I had a push notification letting me know that the conference centre was without power.  Breakfast was still being served there, so my colleague and I made our way to the Fort Mason Center to get coffee and food into our bellies.

Upon arriving there was already a large group of attendees enjoying the sunshine and chatting away while eating delicious baked goods and hot coffee.  We all ended up hanging out until about noon, when lunch was being served.  At this time another announcement was made that there would be power in one of the tents of the conference (thanks to a backup generator) and the rest of the sessions for the day would be recorded and passed on to each attendee after the conference.  Best part was, no one seemed to mind.  This was a great opportunity to meet other developers and talk to them about their stories and what they are trying to accomplish.

It was amazing to see that there were startups, as well as established brands, all thriving from building apps that live in the Shopify App Store.  The full scale of the Shopify App Store, similar to Apple’s own App Store, hit me that afternoon.  It was an incredible feeling.  It took me back to the first day, at the start of the conference, when the partner documentary was shown.  These individuals really were enabling entrepreneurs to become more successful, by providing apps that were relevant to their business models.

## The End
Shopify put on an amazing event last week.  As an attendee, I appreciated the incredible amount of detail that went into the planning and execution.  I especially enjoyed the individual product announcements that took place on the first day.  The partner documentary was the biggest winner of the conference, and I am sure most developers felt the same way.  I hope I am privileged again to attend next year when the conference is held in Toronto, Canada.
