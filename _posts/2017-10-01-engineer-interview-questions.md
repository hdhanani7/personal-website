Several months ago I was at a restaurant chatting with a few friends, all of whom were engineers. While talking about how their interviews for other engineers go, I asked the following question:

*How do you know if the candidate you’re interviewing will be a good communicator and collaborator?*

My two friends looked at me and asked me to elaborate. So I did:

*Do you ever ask how someone would handle reviewing a PR that (a) doesn’t follow a PR template that’s well defined, (b) doesn’t include the info the engineer needs to test drive it, or (c) requires a lot of feedback and/or working with the other engineer to sort out the issues?*

My two friends looked at me again and asked me why it would be valuable to ask that question. I elaborated further:

*Well you don’t know how this candidate might handle something he/she will be doing everyday at work. Something that involves other people on the team. How are you going to know if this person will be able to work effectively with others, offer constructive feedback to another engineer on PRs, and clearly communicate that feedback?*

My two friends looked at me and commented on how interesting that idea was. So I spoke to my own experience getting interviewing and interviewing non-engineers:

*A lot of the questions I get asked or ask candidates is how they would handle specific behavioral situations, such as a designer who doesn’t think the agile process we have is not useful, yet everyone else on the team does, or an engineer who is adding acceptance criteria to a ticket that is counter to what you initially added. As a product manager we work on teams with different skillsets and different personalities, and we have to know how to handle these situations. It’s the same for designers, engineers, or any other discipline that’s working in a cross-functional team. Right?*

My two friends looked at me again and commented on how behavioral questions aren’t asked very often in the interview process. It’s mostly technical plus cultural fit (which I wrote about how we need to shift the mindset and focus on [cultural add](http://hussaindhanani.com/blog/2017/09/24/culture-fit-or-culture-add.html)).

I added my two cents again:

*Wouldn’t it make sense to have some questions that would help uncover whether a candidate would make a good team contributor vs an individual contributor, rather than hire that candidate and find out later? Especially if that person ends up being the opposite of what you were actually looking for?*

I think at that point we all had a sip of our drinks in silence as the music changed from something forgetful to something even more forgetful, yet still providing an opportunity to think about the conversation we just had.

**So what do you think?** Are behavioral questions just as valuable for engineering interviews? Should the focus be solely on technical chops and [cultural add](http://hussaindhanani.com/blog/2017/09/24/culture-fit-or-culture-add.html)?
