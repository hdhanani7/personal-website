The last time you were in a team huddle trying to decide if a candidate was going to fit in, how did that conversation go? How about when you were chatting with a prospective candidate over the phone in order to suss out if he/she had the potential of fitting in with the company’s culture? Chances are the idea of culture fit came up.

Culture fit is a phrase most companies use to determine if a potential candidate will fit in with the team or the organization as a whole. A lot of tech companies use it and it’s probably a common phrase at other types of organizations too. We deem a candidate a good culture fit if they align with our values, they get a long with the team, and we can see ourselves working with this individual for a long period of time.

The problem is that, while culture fit is an appropriate topic to discuss, it seems to be killing our ability to hire an incredibly diverse set of individuals. Individuals that have the potential to add so much value to a team and the entire organization.

When the topic of  culture fit came up in conversations, I honestly didn’t think anything of it. Not until a recent colleague pointed out that we shouldn’t think of a potential candidate as being a good culture fit but being an excellent **culture add**.

This simple modification to how we talk about candidates completely changed my perspective and those around us.

Think about it. Take a roughly homogenous team and talk about a potential candidate’s culture fit. Imagine the number of potentials that would literally be disqualified.

Now make that one simple modification and start talking about culture add instead. What do you get? A realm of possibility opens up when it comes to figuring out who the best candidate might be. Imagine how much stronger a team can be built by following this slight modification. Now let’s turn that modification into a principle we can all practice:

**Don’t hire someone that will just fit in with your company and/or team culture. Hire a candidate that will beneficially _add_ to your culture and make it even better!**

I am so thankful to have been given this simple modification because I think we can all use a few more culture adds in our organizations.
