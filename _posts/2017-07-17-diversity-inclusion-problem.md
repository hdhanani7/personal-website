I haven’t published a new blog post in a very long time. To kick this off again, I wanted to talk about something that is very dear to me.

Being an agent of change involves internalizing the principles of diversity and inclusion. It means that you live the principles and ideas you are trying to promote - both professionally and personally.

I've noticed that we are strong in advocating for and practicing the principles of diversity and inclusion at work. We fall short when we transition from the office to our personal lives. Most people I've observed have homogenous social circles outside of work. Because we don’t apply these principles to every aspect of our lives, we're minimizing our chances to make a significant impact in the world.

Why is it that we can fight so hard for diversity and inclusion yet keep homogenous social circles? Do we not believe the principles we are preaching or do we not see the reality of our situation? As we start to understand how to bring these principles into our personal lives will we begin to see the biggest benefits.

I am not suggesting this is a universal truth, but it’s noticeable enough to write about. I also don’t hear anyone else talking about it. Only a combination of self-awareness and a critical look at who we invite into our social circles will uncover our unconscious biases and begin to remove them.

**Here’s what I have learned from my own self-reflection:**

My primary social circle contains men and women; straight and homosexual; deaf and hard of hearing; German, Canadian, Indian, African, Russian, Austrian, Chinese, and Japanese; low, medium, and high income; low, medium, and high risk aversion; internally driven and externally driven.

I'm not including these lists to make myself look good, but because I've opened my heart and my mind to make sure I get to know as many different people as I can. To learn from each and everyone out there because, at the end of the day, we all have a unique story to tell. If we are willing to listen and understand one another, we can make a positive change in this world.
